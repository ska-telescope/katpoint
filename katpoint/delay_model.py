    This object is purely used as a repository for model parameters, allowing

    as it handles multiple antenna delays simultaneously.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : file-like or model object, sequence of floats, or string, optional
        Model specification. If this is a file-like or model object, load the
        model from it. If this is a sequence of floats, accept it directly as
        the model parameters (defaults to sequence of zeroes). If it is a
        string, interpret it as a comma-separated (or whitespace-separated)
        sequence of parameters in their string form (i.e. a description
        string). The default is an empty model.
